		<hr/>
		<p> This is a simple, customisable fractals using some abstractions, for loops, and recursions, running in Python3 language. In order to run this program, make sure you have <a href= "https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python3's IDLE </a> installed. </p>
		<p> Run fractals.py or one_fractal.py with Python3's IDLE, then input the length of polygon that you want, the sides of polygon that you wish to create, and the smallest length (minimum) that the polygon can be. </p>
		<p> Differences: one_fractal.py is used to output only 1 fractal, while fractals.py used to give 4 fractals. </p>
		<p> Since screen size varies, therefore you may wish to adjust the position of the turtle pointers. open the fractals.py and the adjustment can be made on function move_pens(). </p>
		<p> Recommendations:
		<ol>
			<li> General length = 1000 or 500, depending on screen size </li>
			<li> For triangle: set sides of polygon =3, minimum = 4, and you will get: <br/> <br/><img src="Triangle.jpg"> </li> <br/>
			<li> For pentagon: set sides of polygon =5, minimum = 40 <br/> <br/><img src="Pentagon.png"> </li> <br/>
			<li> Sometimes, there could be some aesthetics created before the loop finishes, for example: set sides of polygon =20, minimum = 29, length =500 <br/> <br/><img src="Polygon_Unfinished.jpg"> </li> <br/>
			<li> Polygons sized 7 to 13 are best to be drawn in 5:1 ratio, i.e. length = 500, minimum: 100 </li>
			<li> More pictures will be added as I experiment with it further </li>
			<li>--- feel free to add more interesting phenomenons of your personal experiments here ---</li>
